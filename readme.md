Rock–Paper–Scissors Game – Project Review (C Programming)
Project Overview

This project is a simple console-based Rock–Paper–Scissors game developed using the C programming language. 
The game allows a user to play against the computer by selecting one of the three options: Rock, Paper, or Scissors. 
The computer’s choice is generated randomly, and the result is displayed based on standard game rules.

Objectives of the Project

To understand basic C programming concepts

To implement conditional statements (if–else)

To use random number generation

To practice user input and output handling

Working Principle

The program displays three options to the user:

1 → Rock

2 → Paper

3 → Scissors

The user enters their choice using the keyboard.

The computer generates a random choice using rand() and srand(time(0)).

The program compares the user’s choice and the computer’s choice.

Based on predefined rules, the program declares:

Match Draw

User Wins

Computer Wins

Technologies Used

Programming Language: C

Header Files: stdio.h, stdlib.h, time.h

Compiler: GCC / Dev-C++ / Turbo C

Advantages

Easy to understand and implement

Improves logical thinking

Demonstrates the use of random numbers

Beginner-friendly project for C programming

Limitations

Only single-round gameplay

No input validation for invalid numbers

No graphical interface

Applications

Learning basic game logic

Practicing conditional statements

Mini-project for C programming labs

Useful for understanding randomness in programs

Conclusion

The Rock–Paper–Scissors project is a simple yet effective C programming mini-project. 
It helps beginners understand core concepts like random number generation, decision-making using conditions, and user interaction. 
This project is suitable for academic purposes and serves as a strong foundation for developing more advanced games in the future.
